 * OAuth is a standard protocol that allows users to authorize APIs to access the web and desktop or mobile applications.
 * Once access is granted, the authorized application can use the API on behalf of the user.
 * OAuth has also become a popular delegation authentication mechanism.

 * Based on OAuth 2.0 protocol (rfc6749), Jap implements OAuth 2.0 server and OAuth 2.0 client,
 * which can dock with any platform supporting OAuth 2.0 standard protocol
